# CrazyCattle3D Web Port
## You can play the game at [crazycattle.club](https://crazycattle.club)!

This repository contains an HTML5 port of the game **CrazyCattle3D** by Anna.  
The original Godot project files were downloaded from the [official itch.io page](https://4nn4t4t.itch.io/crazycattle3d), all credits go to Anna for these.

Assets like `.glb` models and `.wav` audio files have been optimized to greatly reduce file size while maintaining quality. This allows the `.pck` file to load much faster when starting the game.

The `.wasm` WebAssembly file generated by Godot has also been optimized to speed up loading.

This port behaves exactly like the original, with the physics being untouched and user data being saved like usual.
